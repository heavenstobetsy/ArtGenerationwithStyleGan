# Art Generation with StyleGAN

## Notes
This project builds off of, and is inspired by StyleGAN - Official TensorFlow Implementation https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948

I scraped Fauvism art from WikiArt as the basis of this model, as it's a distinct, fun style with bold colors, which results in interesting art being created.

I also used Google Colab notebook for this project in order to learn how it works, and what can be done with it.

## This project currently is a WIP, and partially posted while I evaluate the quality of the artwork.
